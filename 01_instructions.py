This program will ask you for ...
- The name of the recipe you are using
- The names of the ingredients you are using
- How much of it you plan on using
- The costs for the amount of servings you plan to make
- How much it will cost per serving

It will then output an itemised list of the costs 
with subtotals for the variable and fixed costs.
Finally it will tell you how much you should use of 
each item for you to reach your serving goal.

The data will also be written to a text file which
has the same name as your recipe.
